				<h2> Interests </h2>
				<ul> 
					<li><b>Web development</b> (more towards backend)</li>
					<li><b>Japanese to English translation.</b> As mentioned below, I enjoy reading Japanese teenage and young adult literature. My eventual goal is to found a localization company that does such translations, mostly targeting what I see are issues in how companies are currently approaching localization and how the meaning of the original work is being changed from what it could be said as. </li>
				</ul>

				<h2> Hobbies </h2>
				<ul> 
					<li><b>Gaming</b> (currently Valorant, Pokemon, and JRPGs). My favorite games are <i> Super Mario Galaxy (1 and 2)</i>, <i>Pokemon Black/White</i>, and <i>The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero/Trails into Azure. </i> </li>
					<li><b>Streaming.</b> I try to stream at least once or twice a week, since I feel like it's great stress relief for me to be able to talk to people while playing games. I just hit Twitch Affiliate, meaning I can now monetize my channel, and my Twitch can be found <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/pascalswag3r" target="_blank" rel="noopener noferrer">here. </a> </li> 
					<li><b>Exercising.</b> Unfortunately, as I am somewhat of a lazy person and like to get my exercise done in the morning, I don't know anyone who is willing to work out with me at 8 AM every day. Although I myself can't always do that either, especially as the quarter goes on.
					<li><b>Reading.</b> I read a large amount of Japanese novels and manga in the original language. Understanding the language is hard, but there's not too much depth to the works, so it's pretty easy and relaxing to read otherwise. </li>
